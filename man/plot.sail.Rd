\title{Plot Method for \code{sail} object}
\usage{
\method{plot}{sail}(x, type = c("both", "main", "interaction"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{fitted \code{sail} object}

\item{type}{which type of predictors should be plotted. \code{type="both"}
will plot the solution path for main effects and interactions,
\code{type="main"} will only plot solution path of main effects (this also
includes the exposure variable) and \code{type="interaction"} will only
plot solution path for interaction effects Default: c("both", "main",
"interaction"). Default: \code{type="both"}.}

\item{...}{other graphical paramters passed to \code{plot}}
}
\value{
A plot is produced and nothing is returned
}
\description{
Produces a coefficient profile plot of the coefficient paths for
  a fitted \code{sail} object. Both main effects and interactions (if
  present) are plotted.
}
\details{
A coefficient profile plot is produced
